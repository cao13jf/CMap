## Log on development
* [X] Finish initial segmentation with the origin model;
* [x] Add time points as seperate channel to control cell size;
* [ ] How to constrain the width of the predicted membrane mask to get more precie results; 
* [ ] Use nucleus voroni segmentation as as constrain;
* [ ] Loss function on rays distance from the center to the membrane surface --> universe;
* [ ] Augmentation on weak boundary;
* [ ] Few-shot training with only a few slices annotation cross the nucleus center;
